# Files Manager Project
This is the Files Manager project! This project is designed to be a comprehensive learning experience, covering key backend concepts such as authentication, Node.js, MongoDB, Redis, pagination, and background processing. Together, Freda Tsorme-Dzebu and Dorothy Dede Quao, we will embark on a journey to build a simple yet robust platform for uploading and viewing files.


**Project Overview:**

The objective of this project is to develop a Files Manager platform with the following features:

1. **User Authentication via Token:** Implement secure authentication mechanisms using tokens to ensure authorized access to the platform.

2. **List All Files:** Create a feature to list all uploaded files, facilitating easy navigation and management for users.

3. **Upload a New File:** Enable users to upload new files to the platform, enhancing their ability to store and organize digital assets.

4. **Change Permission of a File:** Provide functionality for users to modify file permissions, controlling access to their files.

5. **View a File:** Implement a feature to allow users to view the contents of uploaded files directly within the platform.

6. **Generate Thumbnails for Images:** Automatically generate thumbnails for image files to improve user experience and visual representation.

**Project Guidelines:**

- We will follow a step-by-step approach to build the project, ensuring a structured learning experience for us.
- Flexibility is encouraged in the implementation process. Feel free to split functionalities into separate files and leverage the 'utils' folder for shared utilities.
- Collaboration and communication are key. Don't hesitate to ask questions, share ideas, and seek assistance when needed.

**Purpose:**

While similar services may already exist in the real world, this project serves as a valuable learning opportunity for both of us. By actively participating in the development process, we will deepen our understanding of backend development practices and strengthen our skills in building scalable and secure applications.

**Enjoy the Journey!**

Happy coding!
